Again, NIH's application guide for this fellowship is [here](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-d/fellowship-forms-d.pdf).

The bibliography style file, `ieetrCustom.bst` complies with the citation format NIH asked for in 2017. The sample citations are in `sample.bib`. To cite, use `\cite{}` and compile the `.tex` file with LuaLaTeX, then BibTex, and then LuaLaTeX twice more to see the citations.

## Specific aims

I was advised to focus on the writing of the Specific Aims the most. Your sponsors should have a heavy hand in helping you develop, revise, and tailor this page to the institution.

This page sets the tone of your reviewing process, where reviewers may not even read the rest if this page doesn't make sense to them. You should read examples of successful grants to get a feel.

You have 1 page to convince the reviewers that your work is important, doable, and succinct. Here's a potential outline:

1. Describe the problem

  Provide some background, including some citations of your research topic. The motivation for the problem should be tied to the institution's goals.
2. Describe your solution

  Provide the motivation of your solution and a high-level description of what you're going to do in this grant. You can put your hypothesis for each aim.
3. State your aims

  There are usually 2-3 aims, which should be related or complementary.  
4. Describe the aims with minimal detail

  E.g., datasets, methods, and evaluation.
5. Describe the impact

  Assuming you have finished the research, what are the projected outcomes and what will be learned to move science a bit further?



## Research strategy

This is 6 pages and details the experiments you will do to fulfill the specific aims. These are the required components (along with a potential outline):

1. Significance

  In more detail than before, and with many citations, talk about the importance of the problem. What have people done and what are the challenges you will later address. Since this is an NIH grant, you can include three paragraphs.
  + clinical significance - relevance to health, e.g., improve healthcare
  + scientific premise - relevance to academia, e.g., novel methods, results
  + segue - refer back to each aim (talk about what they will do and their deliverables), and finish with the importance and novelty of these outcomes


2. The experiment design

  For each aim, describe in detail but succinctly:
  + background and motivation for aim - e.g., your literature review (cite often)
  + data - e.g., what will be studied?
  + methods - e.g., how will you study it?
  + evaluation - e.g., how do you measure the outcomes and support your hypotheses?


3. Potential pitfalls and alternatives

  There is no perfect plan. You should be able to provide problems with your proposed experiments and solutions to overcome them. These should be issues that the reviewer can easily pinpoint (address these so you don't have to resubmit).

4. Preliminary results

  Present what you and/or your collaborators have accomplished so far in this work.

5. References

  Have a lot.
